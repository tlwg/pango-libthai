0.1.5 (2006-03-13)
=====
- More PUA support for Mac fonts rendering.

0.1.4 (2004-10-16)
=====
- If available, prefer OpenType tables to PUA substitution rendering.
- Effective PUA-based rendering with Thai OSX fonts.
- Better rendering of dangling upper/lower marks. Now dottedcircle becomes
  optional rather than mandatory. As a result, PUA-based rendering with
  Windows fonts gets turned on again.
- Some code clean-ups.

0.1.3 (2004-09-24)
=====
- Rewrite module entries as per new specification in pango 1.3/1.4.
- Use fontconfig backend instead of x/xft/ft2.
- Handle non-TIS characters. Without that, many apps will crash.
- OpenType support.


0.1.2 (2004-02-22)
=====

- Use dottedcircle as the base for floating upper/lower vowels.
- More strict check in configure script
