Pango-LibThai
=============

Pango-Libthai is a sub-project under LibThai project, which plugs some LibThai 
functionality into Pango rendering engine.

Pango-LibThai provides third-party plug-in for Thai support in Pango text 
layout engine. The main purpose is to provide Pango language engine which
implements break positions analysis, including word breaks, via pango_break()
calls, using LibThai routines. However, a shaping engine is also provided
as a supplementary.

The shaping engine is not meant to replace or duplicate the stock engine
available in Pango. It rather demonstrates another possible code structure, 
in which input and output methods can share some functionalities according
to WTT 2.0, a Thai de-facto standard for input/output methods.
